In this project you need to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MNIST Handwritten digits using Keras. 
We also saved the model file obtained after training. In this part of the tutorial series, we are going to see how to deploy Keras model to production using Flask.
Flask is part of the categories of the micro-framework. Micro-frameworks are normally framework with little to dependencies to external libraries. 
This means that the framework is light and there is little dependency to update and watch for security bugs.
